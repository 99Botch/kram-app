# kram-app

This app was made for my last year final project at IADT. <br/>

Kram is a Vue based web application for flashcards, using a Spaced repetition algorithm to ease the learning curve of any vocabulary type (refer to Kram's API -> https://github.com/99Botch/KramAPI). <br />

I would advise you to look out for the comments in the ```app.js```, ```Home.vue```, ```Repository.Vue```, ```spaced_repetition.js``` and ```./review/Index.Vue``` files as the code keeps repeating itself and of their comments cover the application. Watch out for the report as well.<br/>
